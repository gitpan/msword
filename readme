NAME
    File::MSWord

VERSION
    Version 0.1

DESCRIPTION
    File::MSWord - Perl module to parse MSWord OLE compound documents
    without relying on the MS API. Neither MSOffice nor MSWord need to be
    installed to use this module. The intent of this module is to provide a
    cross-platform method for retrieving metadata from MSWord documents.
    This module parses binary information in the file headers, and
    lists/dumps the various streams and 'trash'.

    All methods return binary values in little-endian order, unless
    otherwise specified.

DEPENDENCIES
    OLE::Storage OLE::PropertySet Startup Carp

    All of the above modules can be installed on ActiveState Perl using the
    PPM command. Consult your documentation for the specifics of how to
    install the modules for platforms other than Win32.

SYNOPSIS
    See file testwd.pl

METHODS
  my $word = File::MSWord::new()
    Creates a new $word object.

  @guid = $word->getGUID();
    Returns a 2-element list containing the halves of the GUID, in
    little-endian order.

  %doc = $word->getDocBinaryData();
    Returns a hash containing various elements of binary header information
    located in the file.

  @ids = $word->getMagicIDs()
    Returns IDS for creator/reviser apps (ie, Word version)

  @dates = $word->getBuildDates()
    Returns 2 DWORDS holding the build dates of the creator/reviser apps

  @list = $word->getSavedBy()
    Returns 2 DWORDS corresponding to the offset within the table stream of
    the list of names (of users who have saved this document, alternating
    with the path the file was saved to), and the size of the buffer.

  @list = $word->getDocUndo()
    Returns 2 DWORDS (offset, size) of undocumented undo information saved
    in the table stream. This is one of several "undocumented" areas of
    undo/versioning information listed in the primary reference.

  @list = $word->getUndocOCX()
    Returns 2 DWORDS (offset,size) of undocumented OCX data within the table
    stream.

  @list = $word->getLastModified()
    Returns 2 DWORDS corresponding to the last modified FILETIME object.
    This information can be fed to a routine using Math::BigInt and gmtime()
    to return something readable.

  @list = $word->getRoutingSlip()
    Returns 2 DWORDS (offset,size) corresponding to the routing slip
    information maintained in the table stream.

  @list = $word->getTwoDWORDs($offset)
    Takes an offset within the file information block (FIB) and returns 2
    DWORDS located in 8 bytes starting at that offset.

  %hash = $word->listStreams()
    Returns a hash of hashes containing the names of the streams of the
    OLE/compound/structured storage document as the keys.

  %hash = $word->getSummaryInfo()
    Returns a hash containing elements of the SummaryInformation stream

  %hash = $word->getDocSummaryInfo()
    Returns a hash containing elements of the DocumentSummaryInformation
    stream

  $buffer = $word->readStreamTable($offset,$size)
    Takes in an offset and size of a buffer within the table stream, and
    returns the contents of the buffer.

  %hash = $word->parseSTTBF($buffer[,$name1,$name2])
    Takes a buffer (extracted from the table stream) and parses it out into
    a hash of hashes, whose keys are the order (1,2,3...) of the entries.
    Optionally, you can pass in the names of the subkeys.

  $landid = $word->getLangID($id)
    Translates the language id from the FIB into something readable.

  %hash = $word->readTrash()
    Reads the trash bins in an OLE/compound/structured storage document.
    Returns a hash of hashes with the names of the trash bins as keys, and
    the size and contents of the bins as subkeys.
